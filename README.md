Functionality: I believe I met expectations for functionality. As far as i know, I have implemented Encrypt/decrypt command line interfaces as expected.

OOP: I'm not quite sure how I did on OOP. It could be "above expectations", it could be "below expectations". I think if I were to do this project again, I might not use as many modules. I am anxious to see what Megan's thoughts are on the layout I implemented. "Above expectations" asks for modules, so I'm hoping that it is well organized.

Ruby Conventions and Mechanics: I am really hoping to get an "Above expectations" in mechanics. I believe almost all of my methods are under 10 lines and I believe I chose the right enumerables for what I was trying to accomplish. I also used unique name for all of my methods.

TDD: I was aiming for an "above expectations" for TDD. I used several mocks and stubs in my tests. I am concerned about coverage only coming back at 98.68% rather 100%.
